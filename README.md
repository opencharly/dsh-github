## Compatibility

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| Harness | DeepSeek Harness `dsh-v0.2.1-alpha.1` (compat declared for `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0 \|\| >=0.1.5-alpha.1 <0.2.0 \|\| >=0.1.6-0 <0.2.0 \|\| >=0.1.7-0 <0.2.0`; 0.1.2-rc.1 adapted 2026-09-09): the review job is owned by a bare `SessionId` and a notice source is the plugin-owned kind `dsh-github` (the host's `Agent \| SessionId` union and its catch-all `kind: 'plugin'` are both gone); the settings card registers on the **Plugins page** (Official group, `plugins.item` slot) and renders from the owner form `dsh-client-ui-plugin-manager` supplies, instead of binding the removed `ctx.settingsScope`; the CI driver auto-approves through the official `ctx.approval.setPolicy` policy seam; the review bot polls as a `ctx.jobs` background job with a timer fallback. Upgraded 2026-09-24 to `0.1.7-rc.2` (typecheck + typecheck:ci + 185 unit tests green). |
| Node | `^22.19.0 \|\| >=24.0.0` |
| Platforms | All (host plugin; outbound network to GitHub) |
| Model | Any (static review is deterministic; `reviewMode: "model"` is optional) |

## What you get

`dsh-github` fills the GitHub gap between `dsh` and tools like Claude Code and Codex: your agent can read, review, open, update, and merge pull requests, read repository metadata and files, comment on and close issues, and search — while a human approves every write and the token stays secret.

- **15 tools** — `pr_create`, `pr_merge`, `pr_update`, `gh_review`, `review_post`, `gh_issue`, `issue_open`, `issue_comment`, `issue_close`, `gh_search`, `gh_repo`, `gh_file`, `gh_repo_search`, `gh_checks`, all canonical JSON via `defineTool`, plus the one-shot `ci_run` when `ci.enabled` is on.
- **4 command families** — `/pr create`, `/review` (start/stop/post), `/issue open`, and `/ci` (`scan`/`status`/`start`/`stop`/`run <pr>`, registered under `ci.enabled`).
- **Full PR lifecycle** — create → review → update (title/body/state/base) → merge (merge/squash/rebase, optional head-branch delete).
- **Inline reviews** — `review_post` posts one summary comment or line-anchored review comments against the PR head commit.
- **Approval-gated writes** — every GitHub write goes through `ctx.approval` (default `ask`, fail-closed); approval reasons preview titles, body sizes, and comment overrides.
- **Token secrecy** — credentials seam → environment → `gh` CLI, resolved per operation, never in logs, events, renders, or errors.
- **Background review jobs** — `/review` runs on `ctx.jobs` with the host's own `job_list` / `job_output` / `job_kill` surface.
- **Resilience** — 429 retry with `Retry-After`/`x-ratelimit-reset` backoff; read tools are concurrency-safe; all calls honor cancellation.
- **CI surface** — the one-shot `ci_run` tool, a polling review bot, and a status-check gate (composite action `action.yml`).

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. install the bundle into your profile
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:PerryLink/dsh-github#main"

# or from npm (published releases)
dsh plugin --profile web add @perrylink/dsh-github

# 2. restart and verify the row
dsh --profile web --dump-config | grep -A3 'id: dsh-github'
```

## Install & uninstall

- **git channel** (latest `main`): `dsh plugin --profile web add "github:PerryLink/dsh-github#main"` — the `prepare` script builds with production dependencies only.
- **npm channel** (published releases): `dsh plugin --profile web add @perrylink/dsh-github`.
- **tarball channel**: `pnpm pack` in this repo, then `dsh plugin --profile web add ./perrylink-dsh-github-<version>.tgz`.
- **uninstall**: `dsh plugin --profile web remove @perrylink/dsh-github` (or remove the row from the profile patch).

## Configuration

All tunables are Schemastery `Config` fields (changeable from cordis.yml). An id-targeted override replaces the whole row — restate every key you need. `cordis.patch.yml` documents each key inline. In the GUI, the **Plugins page settings card** (Official group) reads `tokenRef` from the entry's own configuration form — the `0.1.7-alpha.1` host removed the `ctx.settingsScope` binding and the namespace-registration seam behind it, so the card no longer owns a settings namespace. The GitHub token is not a configuration field at all: the card reports whether the referenced credential is set and writes it through the credentials file, which is where the host half resolves it.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `tokenSource` | `auto` | `auto` (credentials → env → gh) or one of `credentials` / `env` / `gh` |
| `tokenRef` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Credential-seam reference / environment-variable name |
| `defaultOwnerRepo` | — | Fallback `owner/repo` when a call names none and git has no origin |
| `autoCommit` | `false` | Whether `/pr create` may instruct the model to commit+push first |
| `maxDiffChars` | `8000` | Character cap for PR diffs read into reviews |
| `renderExcerptChars` | `2000` | Character cap for the diff excerpt rendered into tool output |
| `maxComments` | `20` | Cap for PR comments listed by `gh_review` |
| `reviewJobTimeoutMs` | `600000` | Deadline for one background review job (fails with `timeout`) |
| `maxReviewRecords` | `50` | Cap for in-memory review-job records; oldest settled records evict first |
| `maxFileChars` | `12000` | Character cap for file contents read by `gh_file` |
| `maxFindings` | `50` | Cap for analyzer findings per review |
| `maxLineLength` | `300` | Line length beyond which the analyzer flags a long-line finding |
| `reviewMode` | `static` | Review engine: `static` (deterministic analyzer) or `model` (one-shot subagent through the host's `subagents` seam; fails loud when the seam is absent) |
| `modelReviewProvider` | — | Subagent provider name for `reviewMode: "model"`; defaults to the first registered provider |
| `maxRetries` | `3` | 429 retry attempts per request |
| `retryBaseMs` | `500` | Retry backoff base (doubles per attempt) |
| `retryMaxWaitMs` | `60000` | Retry backoff ceiling |
| `requestTimeoutMs` | `30000` | Hard per-request timeout; aborts the fetch when exceeded |
| `apiBaseUrl` | `https://api.github.com` | GitHub REST base URL (GitHub Enterprise) |
| `allowedActions` | `['pr.create','pr.merge','pr.update','review.post','issue.create','issue.comment','issue.close','ci.run']` | Write-action whitelist; anything else is denied before approval |
| `workspaceDir` | the calling session's cwd, else process cwd | Working directory for read-only git inspection. When unset, the session creation cwd (`agent.session.header.cwd`) is used — required for a `dsh web` service, whose process cwd is not the session's workspace (see below) |
| `ci` | `{ enabled: false, … }` | CI integration section: polling review bot, status-check gate, and the one-shot `ci_run` tool (all `ci.*` keys live inside it) |

## Tools & surfaces

| Surface | Kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pr_create` | tool | Create a pull request (write; approval-gated) |
| `pr_merge` | tool | Merge a PR (merge/squash/rebase, optional head-branch delete) |
| `pr_update` | tool | Update a PR (title/body/state/base) |

| status-check gate | surface | Publishes the `success` / `needs-changes` verdict per PR head commit (`action.yml`) |

## Architecture

- **Credential seam.** `tokenSource: auto` resolves per operation in the order credentials seam (`GITHUB_TOKEN` reference) → environment variable → `gh` CLI token. The value is a local variable handed to the REST client; it never enters canonical values, renders, cards, command outputs, injected notices, job output, approval reasons, or error messages.
- **Approval gate.** All writes flow through model tools. A `tools/pre-execute` waterfall listener returns `ask` for the write tools, so the registry asks the human through `ctx.approval` (the host logs the `approval/asked` + `approval/decided` audit pair) and fails closed without an answerer. Commands never write directly: a write command gathers read-only context, then wakes the agent so the model runs the gated tool inside a turn.
- **Background review job.** `/review <pr>` starts a `github-review` job on `ctx.jobs`; the job fetches metadata (capturing the head-commit SHA for inline posting), the capped diff, CI checks, and existing comments, then runs the deterministic multi-file analyzer (`src/review.ts`). The job is owned by the calling agent's bare `SessionId` — `0.1.7-alpha.1` fences the registry on `SessionId` with no `Agent` union — so `dsh-tool-jobs` must be composed or `start` refuses. With `reviewMode: "model"`, the job hands the capped diff to a one-shot subagent through the host's `subagents` seam. Completion reaches the session through the host's `dsh-tool-jobs` consumer; the model reads it with `job_output` and publishes it with `review_post`.
- **CI composite action / review bot / status-check gate.** The repo ships a composite action (`action.yml`) that reviews PRs, fixes CI, and writes the report; a polling review bot posts idempotent inline comments; and a status-check gate publishes the verdict per PR head commit. The one-shot `ci_run` tool drives the headless run. Every write stays approval-gated.
- **Repository resolution.** A `gh_*` call resolves its target repo from, in order: an explicit `ownerRepo`; `defaultOwnerRepo`; then the `origin` remote of the **calling session's** cwd (`agent.session.header.cwd`, else `workspaceDir`, else the process cwd). The git-origin step needs both a real checkout and a matching host: public GitHub's REST base is `api.github.com` while its origins are `github.com`, so the host check accepts the provider host under either form (GitHub Enterprise's single host is unaffected). Without the session cwd a `dsh web` deployment — a
  service whose process cwd is not the session's workspace — could never resolve a repo, so
  every `ownerRepo`-less call failed (opencharly/dsh-github#3).

## Permissions & data

- **Permissions**: writes ride the official approval seam; nothing is re-implemented or bypassed. The plugin declares `network:outbound` and `filesystem:write` in its workshop manifest.
- **Data**: the review report lives in process memory keyed by job id; nothing durable is written to disk.
- **Session log**: the plugin adds no custom session event types; all model-visible content flows through host-logged surfaces (`tool/result`, `user/message`, `command/run`, `approval/asked`…). The notices commands queue carry the plugin's own merge-extensible source kind, `{ kind: 'dsh-github', form: 'notice', summary }` — the host has no catch-all `plugin` kind, and its session-format admission path refuses one outright.

## Security boundaries

- **Approval, not enforcement.** Writes only produce `ask`/deny decisions on the official seam; the sandbox and approval systems remain the enforcement authorities.
- **Fail closed.** Missing approval answerer degrades to the strictest decision — never to silent pass-through.
- **The token never leaves the process.** It is read per operation and sent only in the Authorization header; never logged, rendered, injected, or surfaced in errors.
- **No writes outside approval.** `/pr create` never commits or pushes by itself; with `autoCommit: true`, the model performs those writes through the bash tool's own approval gate. The review job performs no writes; only `review_post` publishes, after approval.
- **Untrusted content is escaped and marked.** `formatPostBody` backtick- and HTML-escapes diff-derived file names, and external GitHub content (files, bodies, comments, search results) is marked as external in renders.
- **Bounded work and rate limits.** 429s are retried with backoff; the remaining quota is surfaced on every result, including failures.

## Known limitations

- **No custom session events** — deliberate (see Architecture); audit trails rely on the host's own event vocabulary.
- **Static analyzer by default** — deterministic rules (`src/review.ts`), zero tokens, reproducible. `reviewMode: "model"` costs tokens and requires the `subagents` seam and a registered provider.
- **Jobs and records are process-local** — the review report lives in plugin memory keyed by job id; the record map is capped by `maxReviewRecords` (oldest settled records evict first).
- **npm `latest` dist-tags are stale** — install through the profile closure `dsh-base` provides; never bare `npm i @deepseek-ai/dsh-tools`.

## Interoperability with other DSH plugins

Verified against **DSH `0.2.0-rc.2`** (the runtime this README ships for) and the high-star plugin set surveyed on 2026-10-05.

This plugin **does not interfere** with other plugins, including the widely installed high-star ones:

- **No tool-name collision.** Every tool is namespaced; no bare name owned by a shipped tool or another plugin is registered.
- **No service-key collision.** It provides no service key at all, so it cannot collide on one.
- **No slot collision.** It registers no client slot key, so it cannot contend for a `shadows-shipped-ui` seat.
- **No HTTP route collision.** It registers no `webServer` prefix.
- **No patch-layer collision.** The bundle patch only `insert`s its own row; it never overrides a built-in row's `config`.
- **No global mutation.** It does not patch prototypes, rewrite `process.env`, or replace the global fetch dispatcher.

**Shared event listeners are non-interfering by construction.** It observes the ordering-sensitive event `tools/pre-execute` with `ctx.on()` — Cordis's broadcast registration, where every listener runs and none can starve another. **Every listener here delegates through `next()`**, so the chain is never short-circuited, and a mutation is applied to the value `next()` produced rather than returned in its place:
  - `tools/pre-execute` — also used by `cc-safety-net` (1576★).

Static evidence: `dsh-plugin-doctor` K10–K13 report `pass` for every check on this repository.

### Install from the DSH Desktop Market

All PerryLink plugins are browsable in the built-in DSH Desktop Market: **Market → Sources → add source → paste** `https://perrylink-dsh-catalog.perrylink.workers.dev/catalog-source.json` **→ select it**. Installation still goes through the Market's npm-identity verification and your confirmation.
